### Income Level Prediction Using Data Mining Techniques

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze socio-economic patterns to predict individual income levels using data mining techniques. Classification (Decision Trees) is used to predict whether a person's income exceeds $50,000 per year (High or Low income), while Clustering (K-means) is applied to identify distinct groups of individuals with similar demographic profiles and financial characteristics. 

## Motivation
Understanding the factors that influence income distribution is a vital area of economic research. This dataset provides a real-world foundation for identifying the key attributes—such as education, age, and occupation—that contribute to financial stability. Predicting income levels accurately helps in economic planning and developing strategies for social mobility.
